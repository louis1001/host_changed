# The manor

It's an old temple to the ancient gods. The architecture is rustic and very geometrical, rooms divided by recently added walls and decorations trying to cover the jagged edges.
Through the centuries it became known as haunted, then abandoned, then in ruins, then a touristic attraction. It was bought by some conglomerate which tried to renew it, build actual rooms and halls, and make it into a sort of museum. Eventually, one single rich person got it and started renting it for parties and events.

The building has some altars where they used to pray. Those are the places where the members of the party (possessed) will have to go and drop some blood.
The center of the building is a giant octagon platform, which has been covered with a big table cloth and made into a dinning table. The middle of this platform is where the rupture will appear.

The altars at each corner of the building has a sink that flows into a thin straight canal, pointing directly into the middle platform. When the canal reaches the main hall, it splits and branches multiple times into a sort of tree. These branches are also etched into the platform walls, and when the blood reaches them it will climb and start to drip and flow towards the middle.

Each time a gift (blood sacrifice) is made, there's a burst of air though the whole temple, signifying the embiggening of the whole the god is creating to acquire the matter from this universe.

## The Betrayer

Someone summoned this god. They were the conduit through which all the preparations were made. By the time of the party, they have been stabbed and thrown into a hidden room.

Welcomes the possession. When left alone (because it's possessing someone else for a second) they take notes that might be found on them and give a hint as to what is happening or how it works.

## The God

Someone has to accept its influence to be possessed.
The initial effect is The God mentally overpowering the host, convincing them to obey or be completely gone. Outwardly, the person shows signs of headaches and nausea. They can't speak.

> If a player is possessed, tell them "you can cut me off while I narrate this. Every 3 seconds you may say one word". Maybe a Grit roll. The character is described as being upset and needing to sit down, saying comforting stuff like "I'm ok, just need some rest" or "must have been something I ate", while the player's words break through the facade and show fear.

Every human will instinctually fight against this. After the first wave, the host can choose to accept its influence. And keep their own consciousness, but displaying the worries and anxieties of someone hearing a voice in their mind threatening them.

If the host doesn't comply, it can shut down their consciousness and take over. This is harder to control, and can slow down progress towards its goal.

### Its nature, and ours

The god is a miner, searching for veins of matter in an ethereal mound. Organic matter is worth its weight in gold.

The god has convinced the betrayer that they won't suffer the demise of this universe, and that they will ascend to a plane similar to the god's, with power and authority.

The god can't just collect this vein. It has to allure it. Organic ore is tricky, often protected by the random consciousness that spawns from within. So enough sentient, conscious, intelligent beings belonging to this vein have to agree and *seal the deal*, as it were.
