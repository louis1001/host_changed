A group of old college friends have a tradition. They have a party every couple of years where they share what their lives have been like. The past ones have been getting a little bigger, some of them have gotten married and started building *families*.

And so, with the advice of a... friend, they decide to have the next one at this big old manor outside the city.

(Temp) yada yada yada

One by one, people at the party start feeling sick and needing some time alone. A player can sneak and see how they put a drop of blood on the altar and it flows through the canal towards the middle. And then the burst of air.

Or they can observe the exchange, where a possessed person asks another "do you accept?".

## Weaknesses

- Inhabiting a body means also living among the thought patterns of the host. Even with a totally overpowered person and a shutdown consciousness, it would have to deal with constant thought. People with more going on up there are more difficult to control. People with crippling anxiety will be overwhelming.

## Attacks

- **Dimensional tilt**: the sound of metal dragged across metal, it's rotating your eye around a 4th dimensional axis. You feel everything skew slightly, as if inclining to your right. Walls start disappearing, you see objects cut in half, you can see people's insides. Your left eye becomes cloudy and when you move it side to side, everyone else can see it rotating diagonally instead of horizontally. Now you can actually see a strand, the finger, reaching and touching the head of the current host.
