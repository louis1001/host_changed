**Roll for Shoes** is a tabletop RPG “micro system” with a very simple set of rules.  
The original post is archived at [“I roll to see if I have shoes on!”](https://web.archive.org/web/20200619145843/http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11348/microdungeons-i-roll-to-see-if-i-have-shoes-on), but here are the rules:

1. Say what you do and roll a number of D6s, determined by the level of relevant skill you have.
2. If the sum of your roll is higher than the opposing roll, the thing you wanted to happen, happens.
3. At start, you have only one skill: _Do Anything 1_.
4. If you roll all sixes, you get a new skill specific to the action, one level higher than the one you used.
5. For every roll you fail, you get 1 XP.
6. XP can be used to change a die into a 6 for advancement purposes only.
