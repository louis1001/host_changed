> This will be a "prequel novel". The story of how it came together before the actual campaign.

---

From the depths of outer nothingness a god extends a long, thin finger. It moves expertly, merely brushing adjacent realities on its way to the precious vein of matter it's seeking. And when its gnarled disgusting fingertip reaches its target, piercing through the veil surrounding the star-filled plane, only a cross section of it's multidimensional shape manifests in the form of a floating, putch black dot. It appears a way that could have surprise any unknowing passerby, were it not for the near emptiness of this narrow street of a small city in a small country of the planet, **our** planet, Earth.

The city is *CITY_NAME*, the day is Sunday, and the one person witnessing it all, the one who looks like they were expecting it all along, is me. I was not surprised by the sudden darkening of the skies, nor the disgusting taste of metal in my mouth, nor the abrupt sound of wind escaping towards the empty void my new companion came from. And the reason I wasn't surprised could be better understood by peeking a the strange markings inscribed in the book I'm holding, scratch onto the pavement of this empty street. Or better yet, by my exclaiming and cackling as I realize that it worked; by the way <span style="background: #666">I kneel before the dot of absolute darkness front of me, almost singing with joy while I reach towards it without actually approaching</span>.

I marvel at the warming, assuring and comforting nature of its voice, now crystal clear compared to the past months of dreams and whispers. <span style="background: #666">And surprisingly, it promises an even deeper understanding</span>. Not the first of it's promises, and not the first time my heart <span style="font-size: 1rem; font-style: italic; font-family: Brush Script MT">closer</span> jumps at the thought <span style="font-size: 1rem; font-style: italic; font-family: Brush Script MT">touch</span> of receiving a *gift* <span style="font-size: 1rem; font-style: italic; font-family: Brush Script MT">accept?</span> from it.

Curious. For a second, I ponder whether these are my own thoughts. But I have been through this before, and I've develop techniques to settle myself while communicating with it, so I take a deep breath and separate its words from mine:

<span style="font-size: 1rem; font-style: italic; font-family: Brush Script MT">approach. accept?</span>

And silly as it sounds, me being the one who sought to give it passage into this realm, I consider for a split second the possibility of refusing the request. But that thought provokes an almost physical pain. Of course it would be silly, what was I thinking?

As I step forward holding my hands palm up, I slowly surround the dot and try to bring it near me, but it feels like pressing into a wall with a protruding needle, my hand in contact with immovable and infinitesimally small dot. I endure the pain and wait for *something* to happen.

<span style="font-size: 1rem; font-style: italic; font-family: Brush Script MT">accept! ... accept?</span>

"Well... Of course!", I whisper. " Anything for y–" and at that point, everything goes dark.

The darkness is not that of a moonless night nor of a windowless room. Around me I see shapes similar to the floaters in your closed eye, slithering and swiftly running out of my field of view, just silhouettes of faint gray over black. And I'd be convinced my eyes were just covered if it weren't for the sight of my hand reaching up to my face, trying to pull out whatever cover I could have on. I am the only thing I can sense in this deep void. Me, with this growing headache.

YOU ARE RESISTING. LET GO.

Oh, lord. It's voice is a thousand times louder now. "Resisting? No, I accept you! I brought you!" It can't be, I know I'm fully surrendered to its purpose. Will it understand? What words can I use to make it see my determination?

RESISTING. NOT YOU, YOUR INNER SELF. LET GO.

My– my subconscious? That would be it, of course. Once again, betrayed by my own lack of spine. And how would one control their inner self? How would I quiet my deeper fears?

"Excuse me, master. I'm weak". I'm whimpering, stunned by the realization of my own failure. "I'll be of no use to you".

WEAK, YOU ARE. BUT THAT'LL MAKE YOU USEFUL. OBSERVE.

My surprise vanishes
