## First Rough Draft

> This will be a "prequel novel". The story of how it came together before the actual campaign.

---

From the depths of outer nothingness a god extends a long, thin finger. It moves expertly, merely brushing adjacent realities on its way to the precious vein of matter it's seeking. And when its gnarled disgusting fingertip reaches its target, piercing through the veil surrounding the star-filled plane, only a cross section of it's multidimensional shape manifests in the form of a floating, putch black dot. It appears a way that could have surprise any unknowing passerby, were it not for the near emptiness of this narrow street of a small city in a small country of the planet, **our** planet, Earth.

The city is *CITY_NAME*, the day is Sunday, and the one person witnessing it all, the one who looks like they were expecting it all along, is me. I was not surprised by the sudden darkening of the skies, nor the disgusting taste of metal in my mouth, nor the abrupt sound of wind escaping towards the empty void my new companion came from. And the reason I wasn't surprised could be better understood by peeking a the strange markings inscribed in the book I'm holding, scratch onto the pavement of this empty street. Or better yet, by my exclaiming and cackling as I realize that it worked; by the way <span style="background: #666">I kneel before the dot of absolute darkness front of me, almost singing with joy while I reach towards it without actually approaching</span>.

I marvel at the warming, assuring and comforting nature of its voice, now crystal clear compared to the past months of dreams and whispers. <span style="background: #666">And surprisingly, it promises an even deeper understanding</span>. Not the first of it's promises, and not the first time my heart <span style="font-size: 1rem; font-style: italic; font-family: Brush Script MT">closer</span> jumps at the thought <span style="font-size: 1rem; font-style: italic; font-family: Brush Script MT">touch</span> of receiving a *gift* <span style="font-size: 1rem; font-style: italic; font-family: Brush Script MT">accept?</span> from it.

Curious. For a second, I ponder whether these are my own thoughts. But I have been through this before, and I've develop techniques to settle myself while communicating with it, so I take a deep breath and separate its words from mine:

<span style="font-size: 1rem; font-style: italic; font-family: Brush Script MT">approach. accept?</span>

And silly as it sounds, me being the one who sought to give it passage into this realm, I consider for a split second the possibility of refusing the request. But that thought provokes an almost physical pain. Of course it would be silly, what was I thinking?

As I step forward holding my hands palm up, I slowly surround the dot and try to bring it near me, but it feels like pressing into a wall with a protruding needle, my hand in contact with immovable and infinitesimally small dot. I endure the pain and wait for *something* to happen.

<span style="font-size: 1rem; font-style: italic; font-family: Brush Script MT">accept! ... accept?</span>

## Random Lore Dump



### The manor

It's an old temple to the ancient gods. The architecture is rustic and very geometrical, rooms divided by recently added walls and decorations trying to cover the jagged edges.
Through the centuries it became known as haunted, then abandoned, then in ruins, then a touristic attraction. It was bought by some conglomerate which tried to renew it, build actual rooms and halls, and make it into a sort of museum. Eventually, one single rich person got it and started renting it for parties and events.

The building has some altars where they used to pray. Those are the places where the members of the party (possessed) will have to go and drop some blood.
The center of the building is a giant octagon platform, which has been covered with a big table cloth and made into a dinning table. The middle of this platform is where the rupture will appear.

The altars at each corner of the building has a sink that flows into a thin straight canal, pointing directly into the middle platform. When the canal reaches the main hall, it splits and branches multiple times into a sort of tree. These branches are also etched into the platform walls, and when the blood reaches them it will climb and start to drip and flow towards the middle.

Each time a gift (blood sacrifice) is made, there's a burst of air though the whole temple, signifying the embiggening of the whole the god is creating to acquire the matter from this universe.

### The Betrayer

Someone summoned this god. They were the conduit through which all the preparations were made. By the time of the party, they have been stabbed and thrown into a hidden room.

Welcomes the possession. When left alone (because it's possessing someone else for a second) they take notes that might be found on them and give a hint as to what is happening or how it works.

### The God

Someone has to accept its influence to be possessed.
The initial effect is The God mentally overpowering the host, convincing them to obey or be completely gone. Outwardly, the person shows signs of headaches and nausea. They can't speak.

> <span style='font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: bold'>Gameplay</span>:  
> If a player is possessed, tell them "you can cut me off while I narrate this. Every 3 seconds you may say one word". Maybe a Grit roll. The character is described as being upset and needing to sit down, saying comforting stuff like "I'm ok, just need some rest" or "must have been something I ate", while the player's words break through the facade and show fear.

Every human will instinctually fight against this. After the first wave, the host can choose to accept its influence. And keep their own consciousness, but displaying the worries and anxieties of someone hearing a voice in their mind threatening them.

If the host doesn't comply, it can shut down their consciousness and take over. This is harder to control, and can slow down progress towards its goal.

### Its nature, and ours

The god is a miner, searching for veins of matter in an ethereal mound. Organic matter is worth its weight in gold.

The god has convinced the betrayer that they won't suffer the demise of this universe, and that they will ascend to a plane similar to the god's, with power and authority.

The god can't just collect this vein. It has to allure it. Organic ore is tricky, often protected by the random consciousness that spawns from within. So enough sentient, conscious, intelligent beings belonging to this vein have to agree and *seal the deal*, as it were.


## Story

### How the campaign goes


A group of old college friends have a tradition. They have a party every couple of years where they share what their lives have been like. The past ones have been getting a little bigger, some of them have gotten married and started building *families*.

And so, with the advice of a... friend, they decide to have the next one at this big old manor outside the city.

(Temp) yada yada yada

One by one, people at the party start feeling sick and needing some time alone. A player can sneak and see how they put a drop of blood on the altar and it flows through the canal towards the middle. And then the burst of air.

Or they can observe the exchange, where a possesed person asks another "do you accept?".



## Campaign

### The plan


Cosmic horror in preparation for a small one shot with my Pathfinder 2E group.

### Gameplay System

The system used might be Roll For Shoes, so the actual campaign and interactions can get a little silly. Be prepared.
If instead, we use Kids On Bikes, it will probably be a little more structured and I'll have more control over the theme and difficulty.
