Cosmic horror in preparation for a small one shot with my Pathfinder 2E group.

## Gameplay System

The system used might be Roll For Shoes, so the actual campaign and interactions can get a little silly. Be prepared.
If instead, we use Kids On Bikes, it will probably be a little more structured and I'll have more control over the theme and difficulty.

## Story points

[[Random Lore Dump]] contains the scratchpad for unstructured lore behind the characters and world.
[[First Rough Draft]] is where I'll be writing in prose and planning out individual chapters.
